## Description

The show is an American crime drama television series created and produced by *Vince Gilligan* for AMC. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows *Walter White* (*Bryan Cranston*), an over-qualified, dispirited high-school chemistry teacher struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. White turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, *Jesse Pinkman* (*Aaron Paul*), to produce and distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld.
